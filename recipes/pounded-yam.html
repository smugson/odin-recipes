    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pounded Yam is a staple in many West African homes, but it is not usually eaten by itself, it is often paired with many delicious African soups, and stews like Egusi, okra soup, Jute leaves soup (Ewedu), or Stewed Spinach (Efo Riro).</p>
    <p>In multiple world regions, other unrelated root crops are also referred to as Yam. For example, in the united states, the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes are often referred to as Yams, and in Japan, konjac corms are often referred to as yams. However, all these are totally different from what we use.</p>
