    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ewa riro is a delicious one-pot Nigerian delicacy that is easy to prepare but yields a rich flavor. This is truly the best-stewed beans recipe that you will ever taste. Plus it’s incredibly economical.</p>
    <p>Beans Stew is a favorite dinner in our house, it’s warming, hearty, tasty, and quite filling. We usually serve it with Garri (cassava flakes), fresh bread, or fried ripe plantains. However, it pairs so well with plain boiled rice, and cornbread.</p>
    <P>Ewa riro which is also referred to as beans porridge or stewed beans is a Nigerian delicacy from the Yoruba-speaking part of the country. It is made by boiling beans until it’s tender, then we stew it up. Yes, it’s that easy. ”Ewa” means ”Beans” and ”Riro” means ”stirred” so ”Ewa riro” literally means ”stirred Beans” but this time around it’s beans stirred in a type of stew or simply put ”stewed Beans”</P>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Black eyed peas</li>
        <li>Bell peppers and scotch bonnet </li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Bouillon Powder </li>
        <li>Palm Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick (sort) the Beans and rinse:</strong> To prepare this delicacy, it’s important to start with clean Beans. Try as much as possible to This is so important because chewing on stones or debris while eating is not a pleasant experience at all. Rinse out the Beans a couple of times and drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the beans:</strong> Pour the beans into a large pot. Add the peppers, onion, and smoked turkey wings. Cook until the Beans is very tender. This should take about 1 hour to 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. It will even cook faster if you use a pressure pot. The crockpot also works well.</li>
        <li><strong>Stew and season the beans:</strong> Once the Beans are well cooked and soft remove the peppers, onion, and turkey from the beans. Blend the peppers and add back to the beans. Debone the turkey wing and cut it into bits and return that also to the beans. Add the salt, crayfish, seasoning powder, and palm oil. Stir well. Cover it up and leave to simmer for about 3 to 5 minutes and your beans porridge is ready!</li>
